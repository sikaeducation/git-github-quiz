# Git Basics

**Diagram Git / GitHub workflow**

1. Workflow for starting a new project: Provide a brief walk through of what steps you take when you initialize a local repo, do some work and push it to a GitHub repo.
  - Guiding questions:
    - How does Git know to start tracking changes you make to your project?
    - How does Git know where to push your repo to?
1. Workflow for forking: Provide a brief walk through of the steps you take when you fork a repo, bring it down to your local machine, make some changes and push it up to GitHub.
  - Guiding questions:
    - Does the owner of the forked repo know anything about the changes you make to your forked copy? If so, how?
    - When you fork a repo how do you connect a remote so you can push to GitHub?
